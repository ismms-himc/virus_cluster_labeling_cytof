    Missing clusters in different patients.


  naming: crude-classifier_specific cluster

  take meta-labels apply to single sample

  consistency across patients

Downsides
  sprse cluster
  apply names (should be automated)

  Mostly surface markers (zika virus)

  100s of patients infected with viruses.

  Hoping to compare these?

  Summar heatmap - correlate to check which clusters correspond to old datase.

  Panels are ~90 same

  Compare overlapping markers

Would like to make a Data dictionary
-------------------------------------

Final step matrix relabeling

  create a new naming structure (another labeling CSV)

  Labeled and un-labeled datasets.


Notes
*****

  Here’s the correctly annotated dataset:

    MetaHybridLouvain

  Here’s the one that needs to be relabeled:

    meta_clustering

  I'll need to combine the data into the summary over all patient clusters.
